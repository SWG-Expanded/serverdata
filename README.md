# Server Data Repository

This is the server side client data repo ONLY. DO NOT include files in this repo that would normally be used ONLY on the client side.  Store only files necessary for the SERVER operation here.  This would exclude files like sound files and MOST appearance files that do not have collision.

# Usage

The contents of this repo belong in the following SWG path:

    /path/to/swg/data/sku.0/sys.client/compiled

The repo is cloned via the ANT build process currently and the location is handled properly, however, you can still perform manual tasks as needed with this repo.  It's our assumption cloning manually is not needed.

# Useful Changes Appreciated

If you make any useful changes or improvements, put in a pull request/merge request and I'll merge it in, and you'll become a contributor!
